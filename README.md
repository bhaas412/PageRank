# PageRank
Implementation of Google's PageRank algorithm on the given dataset "hollins.dat" in Python.

The first line in "hollins.dat" represents the number of nodes (web pages) V and the number of edges (hyperlinks) E.
The following V lines are the website indexes and links.
The following E lines are the source nodes and destination nodes.

Running "page_rank.py" will read in the data from "hollins.dat" and output the rankings to "final_rankings.txt."
The implementation of the algorithm performs 100 iterations to obtain accurate values.
